--7.6 - Think About It: Why does LAST_VALUE() require RANGE BETWEEN 
--UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING to return the actual last value 
--in the partition, while FIRST_VALUE() works correctly with the default frame? 
--What is the default window frame when ORDER BY is specified, and how does 
--that explain the behavior?


--What is the Default Window Frame?
--When we specify an ORDER BY clause inside OVER() but do not explicitly 
--define a ROWS or RANGE frame, SQL automatically applies this hidden default:
--\[\textbf{RANGE\ BETWEEN\ UNBOUNDED\ PRECEDING\ AND\ CURRENT\ ROW}\]
--This means the window starts at the very first row of the partition 
--and dynamically grows, stopping exactly at the current 
--row (or the last duplicate/peer value of the current row).

--Behavior: 
--To visualize this, imagine a partition with 3 rows ordered by a 
--date: [A, B, C].Why FIRST_VALUE() Works Perfectly As SQL processes 
--each row using the default frame (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW):
--At Row 1: The window contains [A]. The first value is A.
--At Row 2: The window expands to [A, B].The first value is still A.
--At Row 3: The window expands to [A, B, C]. 
--The first value is still A. Because the start of the window is anchored at 
--UNBOUNDED PRECEDING, the first row never changes. FIRST_VALUE() always sees it.

--Why LAST_VALUE() Fails (Without Explicit Framing) Using the exact same 
--default frame (UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW):
--At Row 1: The window is [A]. The last value in this window is A.
--At Row 2: The window expands to [A, B]. The last value in this window is now B
--.At Row 3: The window expands to [A, B, C]. The last value in this window is now C.
--Because the window frame ends at the current row, 
--LAST_VALUE() can never look ahead to see the actual end of the entire 
--partition. It is trapped by the moving boundary.
